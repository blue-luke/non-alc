## Overivew

This was a short exercise designed to practice my API skills. The aim was to set up an API providing JSON data on non-alcoholic drinks in a short amount of time.

## Setup

Download the repo and push it to a host such as heroku.
Run db:migrate and db:seed to populate with sample data.

Exposed paths are:
- /drinks

## Next steps

- Populate the db with data
- Use a serializer to structure the JSON, enabling nested data
- Clarify fetch routes and responses

## Possible next steps

- Create a web-scraper or file-scraper to auto-populate additional information

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
